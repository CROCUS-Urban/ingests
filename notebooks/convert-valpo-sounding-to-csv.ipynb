    "### MODIFICATION HISTORY:\n",
    "#   Believed to have originally been written by Courtney, then modified by \n",
    "#   Alycia Gilliland for GRAINEX and RELAMPAGO (2019).\n",
    "#   \n",
    "#   Updated by Maiana Hanshaw (03/28/2020):\n",
    "#       1. Updated code to import/output Geometric Height (GPS Altitude) in addition to \n",
    "#          Geopotential Height\n",
    "#       2. Added code to be able to handle rts/csv files from all vehicles (DOWs, SCOUTs, & UIUCs)\n",
    "#       3. Added code to import hours, minutes and seconds from rts file and not file name,\n",
    "#          so this no longer needs manually updating.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   Updated by Paul Robinson (08/04/2022):\n",
    "#\t\t1.\tChanged input path to current directory \"./\"\n",
    "#\t\t2.  Changed input file wildcard to \"rts.txt\" so all .rts files in current directory run.\n",
    "#\t\t3.\tFixed header units row by adding \"m\" in \"GPSAlt\" column.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   Updated by Josh Aikins (08/31/2022):\n",
    "#       1.  Made code so that input filename is not case sensitive ('rts.txt' or 'RTS.txt' work)\n",
    "#       2.  Made code so that script does not need to be in same directory as files\n",
    "#       3.  Now outputs blank/empty data for missing data rather than the strange \"///\" strings\n",
    "#           that show up in the RTS data files, since ASPEN expects blank data for missing\n",
    "#       4.  Cleaned up code (removed not used features, renamed variables, added comments)\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   Updated by Josh Aikins (09/05/2023):\n",
    "#       1. Adapted from convert_rts2csv_GRAW5.14.10.3.py to work with new GRAWMET 5.16.04.22\n",
    "#       2. Added print statements so user can detect issues while running code\n",
    "\n",
    "### PURPOSE:\n",
    "#   To read in raw \"RTS\" data files produced by GRAWMET (version 5.16.04.22) and output into \"CSV\"\n",
    "#   format so that they can be run through ASPEN. See online documentation here:\n",
    "#       https://ncar.github.io/aspendocs/man_input.html\n",
    "#   \n",
    "#   RTS data filename convention must match the following, where <VID> is the vehicle ID or name \n",
    "#   and dates/times are referencing the launch time:\n",
